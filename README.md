Open-Source Library For Swarm Algorithm And Communication

Imitation  of  swarming  behaviors  of social animals  offers a new way of designing systems due to simple rules,
local interactions, ro-bustness, scalability, and flexibility. Following this method, a swarm of multiple  robots can
cooperatively  achieve  a  goal  with  collective  intelligence. However, only a few such robotic systems are 
developed, and again very few are deployed outside  of lab environments. The reason behind this is the lack of 
easy-to-deploy communication stack and a versatile library of essential swarm building functions from a hardware perspective.
As a result, most researchers choose the option of simulationonly. Hence we present an open-source
library integrated with a communication stack and tools which simplifies the process of hardware-level implementation
of swarm algorithms. As the library presents multiple functions which are identified as basic building blocks of various swarm algorithms,
it helps the user in creating future algorithms. Also,  this  library is open for collaborations from community and has
a potential to become single solution for all swarm related applications.
